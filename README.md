# Math & Physics Study

This repository contains my notes and progress from my independent study of university-level mathematics and physics.  
I work through several advanced textbooks and document my understanding in my own words.

## Current books
- *Linear Algebra Done Right* — Sheldon Axler  
- *Classical Mechanics* — John R. Taylor  
- *Introduction to Electrodynamics* — David J. Griffiths  
- *Real Mathematical Analysis* — Charles Pugh  

## Structure
- **LinearAlgebra/** — notes, proofs, and exercises  
- **ClassicalMechanics/** — concepts and derivations  
- **Electrodynamics/** — field theory and calculations  
- **RealAnalysis/** — definitions, theorems, and proofs  

## Purpose
- Build a strong theoretical foundation  
- Prepare for a future double bachelor in Physics & Mathematics  
- Keep a structured record of my academic development
